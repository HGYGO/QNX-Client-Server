# QNX-Client-Server
Introduction During the course of a semester at Algonquin college in the CST8244 Real-Time Programming class, I built a Client - Server based bidirectional Real-Time Application on QNX operating System. This was a project in which I learnt about and applied knowledge associated with:

	1.) Characterize a Real Time Operating System.
		* Real Time System Definition.
		* Differentiate hard, soft and firm Real-Time systems.

	2.) Use the QNX Operating System to develop Real Time Applications
		* Describe the component structure of the QNX Neutrino Operating System.
		* Explain the scheduling algorithms used in the QNX Neutrino OS.
		* Start QNX Neutrino in a virtual machine and navigate around the QNX Momentics IDE to perform file.
		* Management, source code creation, compiling and linking programs.
		* Use the Momentics IDE environment to run and interact with programs within the QNX OS.
		* Use QNX Momentics to check file status, process, program and system status.
		* Define Process, Thread and their relationship to each other.
		* Clearly explain and use the internals of Inter Process Communication (IPC) messages as applied in QNX 		Neutrino.
		* Define and use mutexes and semaphores
		* Differentiate between POSIX and non-POSIX functions in QNX Neutrino.

	3.) Explain and utilize timing and interrupts to be able to create a Real Time system.
		* Explain the concepts of interrupt driven systems.
		* Explain how to use signals or pulses to have processes or threads respond to interrupts.
		* Explain the different types of timers used in a Real Time system.
